#
# Victor's rule, in three dated halves:
#
#   2026-09-09: *"Niciodată să nu mai dai restart la Walkie Talkie … în dictare.
#   Oprești și aștepți să se termine dictarea, să se livreze, abia apoi faci
#   restart."* *"Legat dar nu în dictare poți să-l restartezi totuși — ideal ar fi
#   să-l re-legi la același terminal automat."*
#
#   2026-09-23: *"Whenever you restart it, make sure it's not currently dictating
#   or transcribing. Make sure it's idle before you restart the app … After the
#   clean insert of the text [and submit], only then restart. Maybe, granted, even
#   10 more seconds in case I routed the prompt to the wrong place, and then only
#   then restart."*
#
#   2026-09-28, after a restart at 18:39:14 landed while he was dictating: *"someone
#   just restarted the walkie while I was dictating. that should never happen
#   (while dictating or transcribing). restart is only possible after 5 secs of
#   inactivity after the last insert of text."* And at 21:20: *"there should only
#   be 5 seconds since the last ended dictation for the walkie deploy to be
#   authorized to happen"* — his hands do not hold the gate, only a dictation does.
#
# So, in order:
#
# 1. **Wait for the gate** — `tools/restart_gate.py wait`: nothing dictating or
#    transcribing on any engine (`GET /test/state.busy` — the app's own
#    `restartBlockers`: every microphone, the recogniser, the local fallback, the
#    sentence queue, the live caption, a Wispr sentence behind the firewall, the
#    prompt on screen, a sentence held for a bind, the words being typed, a spawn
#    until its window is bound, audio staged for Recover — plus Wispr Flow's own
#    microphone and a History row it is still working on, also read by the gate
#    itself for older builds), then five seconds since the last ended dictation
#    (insert, dictation edge, busy poll). The countdown starts over on anything new. An app that does not answer is waited
#    for, and refused after a minute (exit 4) — never restarted blind. Polled
#    every second; unit-tested by `evals/test_restart_gate.py`.
# 2. **Read the binding** from `~/.walkie-talkie/bound-tty` — before the SIGTERM
#    as a fallback, and again **once the process is gone** (2026-09-26, TD12): an
#    app being replaced leaves the binding it had *at quit* there, so a bind made
#    while the quit was deferred is the one put back. Cleared at launch. For tmux
#    the line is `ttysNNN %N` and the pane travels too (TD13); a Terminal tab adds
#    `owner=PID@START` on a second line (TD21) and a tty now hosted by another tab
#    is not re-bound.
# 3. **Quit gracefully: SIGTERM**, which since 2026-09-23 the app routes through
#    `applicationShouldTerminate` — and if a sentence started in the second
#    between the gate and the signal, the app refuses the quit and goes when the
#    words have landed (`quitPending`), and this waits for it. `.replacing` is
#    kept fresh meanwhile so no `session_end` reaches the watching agent. SIGKILL
#    only if the app neither exits nor says it is finishing a sentence within 15 s.
# 3½. **With `--build`, swap the staged bundle in now** (2026-09-28): the process is
#    gone, so no running app ever has its bundle replaced under it. Swapped at
#    19:54 and left running while the gate waited, the old app's AppleEvents to
#    Terminal were refused — every bind failed until the relaunch at 20:01.
# 4. **Relaunch through LaunchServices**: `open -g "/Applications/Walkie Talkie.app"`.
#    Never the executable path (TCC files a path launch as a second app), and `-g`
#    so the relay he gets back is not in front of the terminal he is typing in.
# 5. **Re-bind** the same tty with `POST /bind {"tty", "pane"}` — no toggle, no
#    flight, and not a deliberate bind (it never takes a sentence's caret or spawn).
#
# 6. **Reload the Chrome extension** when `chrome-extension/` differs from what was
#    last reloaded (2026-10-07: the ⌘⇧ badge was committed at 13:25 and Chrome
#    still showed the old one at 13:35 — nothing in the deploy touched Chrome).
#
# Sourced by docs/shoot-overlay-states.sh for `relay_wait_idle`, `relay_bound_tty`
# and `relay_rebind`; run directly to restart.
